### Abstract :bookmark_tabs:

This paper addresses the problem of translating night-time thermal infrared images, which are the most adopted image modalities to analyze night-time scenes, to daytime color images (NTIT2DC), which provide better perceptions of objects.
We introduce a novel model that focuses on enhancing the quality of the target generation without merely colorizing it. The proposed structural aware (StawGAN) enables the translation of better-shaped and high-definition objects in the target domain.
We test our model on aerial images of the DroneVeichle dataset containing RGB-IR paired images.
The proposed approach produces a more accurate translation with respect to other state-of-the-art image translation models.
